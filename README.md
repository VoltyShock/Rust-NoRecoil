# Rust-NoRecoil
Rust Python Scripts Used To Control Recoil

These Scripts So Far Are Undetectable From EAC\
However, I take no responsibility if your accounts get banned, these are a form of cheats.

Based off of: https://github.com/realstrings/Rust-recoil-compensation

## Installation
- Make sure you have python install if not install it from here: https:`//www.python.org/downloads/ `
- After that download the win32 library through cmd promt with: `pip install pywin32`
- Download the scripts in a zip file from her: `https://github.com/VoltyShock/Rust-NoRecoil/archive/refs/heads/Test.zip`
- After that make sure the address of the recoil table file is save properly in your python file, look for the line of 
code that says `RecoilTable = json.load(open("Rust-NoRecoil/RecoilTables", "r"))` and change accordingly

## Quality and Quirks
- These scripts are not perfect expect at least 85% from all guns included
- You can improve them manually by changing values in the recoil tables file, remember [x value, y value]
